3-Layer Evaluation System for DayZero

This module implements the complete 3-layer evaluation approach:
1. AI Scoring - Evaluates submission structure, judgment, and clarity
2. Teammate Ratings - Incorporates feedback from simulated teammates
3. Domain Expert Review - Quinn synthesizes behavioral evidence and makes final assessment

The SkillRecord represents verified proof of work performance, not credentials.
